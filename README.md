# NBA-Points-Model-CL

This project applied machine learning techniques on a team's average stats to predict the number of points a team will score in a NBA game. This project also explored various sports betting strategies. Predictions were combined with an optimized betting strategy and tested on NBA games from 2012-2021 as an evaluation of their real world effectiveness.
